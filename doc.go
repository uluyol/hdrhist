/*
Package hdrhist provides high dynamic range (HDR) histograms.

HDR histograms can be used to accurately record and analyze
distributions with very large ranges of data.
This HDR histogram implementation is meant to have minimal memory usage
and support recording values quickly.
With a precision of 3 significant digits and a range of 1000-100 billion
(e.g. 1 Î¼s to 100 s), an HDR histogram consumes about 156 KB.
Benchmarks show that recording a value in a histogram should take about 12 ns
depending on the hardware.

A typical usecase for HDR Histograms would be recording latency values
in client or server software.

This package is a Go port of Gil Tene's HdrHistogram Java package
(http://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/).
Package hdrhist aims to interoperate with HdrHistogram
to the fullest extent possible.

Unless otherwise noted, none of the types in the package are safe for concurrent use.
